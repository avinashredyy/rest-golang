//1. We implement the home method which has a switch case implemented depending on the type of request we get.
//2. The function signature of home is simalr to ServeHTTP. That is, we are using http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request just like
//ServeHTTP.
//3. So basically if you want to use your function with http.HandleFunc(), you need to pass http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request
//as parameters to your function.
//4. The http.HandleFunc() allows us to pass our function home that has the same signature as the ServeHTTP
//5. Since we will be passing this function to the http.HandleFunc() it automatically detects that our function satisfies
//the function signature condition of ServeHTTP

	//1. Handle registers the handler for the given pattern and the second argument is the function that we want to execute when
	//the mentioned path in the first parameter is hit("/" in this case).
	//2. Only http.HandleFunc() allows us to pass any function(home() in this case) that satisfes the function signature condition
	//of ServeHTTP
	//3. http.Handle() does not allow this. For http.Handle() we need to create a struct and then pass it as a reciever to our
	//function. Then initialize that struct in main so that we get access to the function.
